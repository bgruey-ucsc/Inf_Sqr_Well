	README for the Infinite Square Well Numerical Solution

In order to learn git and fuck around with some computation, we're screwing around with this problem.

This is not a file.

Ok, it is a file, but that's beside the point.

I started this with ROOT, that's what is in the file "headers.h." 
It's the ROOT objects I most often use, so I just tossed them all into one file. 
If you're on *nix, installing ROOT is generally doable. Else, get a *nix machine then try.
